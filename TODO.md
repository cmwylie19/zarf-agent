# Initial POC

_The goal is to implement the Zarf Agent in Pepr utilizing dependency injection to loosely couple hook implementations of objects like pods and flux._  

**For the initial vertical,the focus is on pod logic.**

_High Level Overview_:
* Zarf Agent needs to be deployed before Zarf deploys artifacts. (Alternatively we could mount the zarf secret into the agent pod)

  * Pods - Agent must mutate the `imagePullSecrets` and `image` to use the internal registry.

    * `imagePullSecrets` - The agent will recreate `private-registry` secret in the pod namespace before mutating the pod.

**Checklist**  

Step 1: (Initialization Phase)
- [ ] Get Zarf State from secret and store in state
- [ ] Get private-registry secret and store in state


Step 2: (Pre-Mutation Phase)
- [ ] Get Pod without ignore labels/annotations
- [ ] Deploy private-registry secret to pod namespace

Step 3: (Mutation Phase)
- [ ] Mutate pod with imagePullSecret
- [ ] Mutate pod with internal registry image
- [ ] Annotate pod `zarg-agent: patched`


_715mb CD-ROM is the goal_

- watch for namespaces without zarf-ignore label
